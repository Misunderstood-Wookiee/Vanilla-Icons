# X4 Foundations Vanilla Icon Pack
### About The Mod
**This is an patch that replaces ships and some station icons with custom icons derrived from XRebirth and my own designs.**

* Various Ship Roles now have Role exclusive icons to represent them, no longer is every ship just a triangle anymore! Bomber, heavy-fighter, scout, frigate, destroyer, carrier, re-suppl, you name it all classes have stylised icon

* Faction Exclusives. Xen and Khak have totally unique icon themes to represent them! Other factions still use standardised design.

* Icons are sized to match their class no two classes are exactly the same size on the map.

## Install
**Just place it into your extensions folder like any other mod.**
>Note please make sure you already have your game version 3.0 or later.
